# Timer Display Removal Update - Tactical Training App

## ✅ **Update Successfully Completed**

### **What Was Changed**
- **Removed all timer displays** from the training interface
- **Maintained background timing functionality** for automatic training flow
- **Preserved all other features** including images, voice commands, and statistics

### **Before vs After**

#### **Before:**
- Large yellow countdown timer displayed prominently (e.g., "2.5s", "1.0s")
- Timer was visually distracting during training
- Created pressure and anxiety for users

#### **After:**
- ✅ **No timer display visible** - Clean, focused interface
- ✅ **Background timing still works** - Automatic transitions between actions
- ✅ **Better user experience** - Focus purely on training actions and images

### **Technical Changes Made**

#### **Code Changes:**
```jsx
// REMOVED: Timer display section
// <div className="text-4xl sm:text-5xl lg:text-6xl font-bold text-yellow-400 mb-8 sm:mb-12 animate-pulse">
//   {timeLeft.toFixed(1)}s
// </div>

// KEPT: Background timer functionality for automatic transitions
const startTimer = () => {
  // Timer logic remains intact for training flow
}
```

#### **What Still Works:**
- ✅ **Automatic training flow** - Actions transition automatically
